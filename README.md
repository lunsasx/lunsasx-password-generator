# lunsasx powerful password generator generator
helps you come up with a strong password

<h1> How do I run the program? </h1> 

It's simple, there are two methods:
*download the executable file from the RELASE tab.
*compile the .cpp file using visual studio or another compiler on windows

<h1> Are these passwords really secure? </h1> 

*Yes! The generator itself does it randomly by making it safe, the question is how many characters you choose? the more the better therefore a password of 3 characters is not a good idea....

psssst i recommend with a MINIMUM of 20 characters (that's what you have a password manager for so you don't have to remember them right?)

<h1> Will the program be developed? </h1>

*Well, of course! I have a ton of ideas to improve the program :p
